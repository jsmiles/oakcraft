# Oakcraft
Oakcraft is the name of a fictional family bespoke furniture maker in the UK. I created a marketing website that can be found deployed [here](https://oakcraft.netlify.app/). This project was an opportunity to learn two very interesting technologies. For styling I utilised [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This library has become a default among many in the tech community and I was excited to learn more about it. Also, I wanted to learn [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). I was first introduced to Alpine in a blog but had no desire at the time to learn another JS framework. However, while learning [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) its ability to supplement the UI in a lightweight manner was intriguing. 

# Lessons Learned
* I am a big fan of both technologies. Tailwind CSS makes it very easy to create interesting styles but unlike other CSS options you have enough freedom to create unique designs. 
* Alpine.js does seem superfically simple and basic. However, it is very powerful. Also, it works very well with Tailwind. 
* The big downside of Tailwind from my experience is that the HTML can become very cluttered. Also, you are repeating much of the same code. As such I don't think using less code is the primary advantage of Tailwind. Rather, it is the ease of debugging. 
* Design is very hard. To create quality professional and engaging designs takes a lot of time and effort. 

# Local Dev Deployment
Probably the simplest approach for a local deployment would be to do the following
```
1. Download the index.html file and the css directory containing the main.css file, maintaining the file structure
2. Using VS Code as an editor download the Live Server extension. 
3. Right click on the index.html file and Open With Live Server should be an option. 
```
